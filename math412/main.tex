\section*{Definitions}

\subsection*{walk}

A \textbf{walk} is a sequence of vertices in $G$, beginning with $u$ and ending at $v$ such that consecutive vertices in the sequence are adjacent.

$$ W=(u =v_0, v_1, ..., v_k, v),$$

where $k \ge 0$ and $v_i$ and $v_{i+1}$ $(0 \le i \le k - 1)$ is said to lie on or belong to $W$.
This does not require the list of vertices to be distinct.

A \textbf{trivial walk} is a walk of \textbf{length} 0.

\subsection*{trail}

A \textbf{trail} in a graph $G$ is a $u-v$ walk in which no \textbf{edge} is traversed more than once.

\subsection*{path}

A \textbf{path} in a graph $G$ is a $u-v$ walk in which no \textbf{vertex} is traversed more than once.

\subsection*{circuit}

A \textbf{circuit} in a graph $G$ is a closed trail of length 3 or more.
A circuit begins and ends at the same vertex but repeats no edges.
